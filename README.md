### Description of files
* build_python.py: sets up a basic model based on Keras MNIST data
** note: increasing the number of epochs to 20 increases the accuracy to 0.9963

### How to test for replicability:
* sample_output.txt: provides output information for the basic model

### How to modify the files for reusability:
1) To improve model:
- change the number of epochs in line X

2) To use the model for different data:
- change the input data; change size of training and test data sets based (as needed)
